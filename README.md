# portfolio-challenge

## Description

This project was my first website built from scratch to use many of the new techniques I'm learning in class. These include, linking to sections within the page, linking to other pages, adding images, and designing the page to be responsive to different screen sizes. This is a draft of my personal portfolio page which will get updated as I develop more applications and improve my skills.
